# Ray's Killswitch
Fun fact: The original name was supposed to be 'the Low-Orbit Ion Death-Ray' (LOIDR) so that's why some assets in the project are called LOIDR

A minimalistic 'kill-switch' with an inituitive website that anyone (even your friends) can use to terminate a living process on your PC.

This is currently being developed (only) for Windows, but the Linux release will be available soon.
