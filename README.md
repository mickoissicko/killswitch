# Ray's Killswitch
Ray's Killswitch is also known as the Low-Orbit Ion Death-Ray.

Seems familiar? That's because the name is inspired by a DDoSing tool -- Low-Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC).

A minimalistic 'kill-switch' with an inituitive website that anyone (even your friends) can use to terminate a living process on your PC.

This is currently being developed (only) for Windows, but the Linux release will be available soon.
